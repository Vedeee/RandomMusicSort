| Extension | Support | Discription                                                      |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MP3       | 游릭      | Fully support                                                    |
| Flac      | 游릭      | Fully support                                                    |
| Ogg       | 游릭      | Fully support                                                    |
| Wav       | 游리      | Fully supports sort in name, partially supports sort in metadata |
| Wv        | 游리      | Fully supports sort in name, partially supports sort in metadata |
| Dsf       | 游리      | Fully supports sort in name, partially supports sort in metadata |

Formats marked with 游리 incompletely support sort in metadata. The data is written to a file, but Windows Explorer does not display it. However, this can be fixed by programs such as AIMP (tag editor)
## Random
RMS has a random audio file sorting feature. When this function is selected, the tracks will be numbered randomly each time the program is called.
## Variants of sort

### In name
This type of sorting involves changing the file name alphabetically (in standard mode) or randomly (by selecting the appropriate function)
### In metafata
This type of sorting involves changing the metadata of the file by changing the track number in alphabetical order (in standard mode) or in random order (by selecting the appropriate function)
